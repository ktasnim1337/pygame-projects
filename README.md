<h1> Cart Rider</h1>
<p> Cart Rider is a game where the car is being controlled by the player using the the up and down arrows. Whenever the "up" arrow is being pressed, the car will shirnk, making it look like it's moving forward and whenever the "down" button is being pressed the the car will get bigger making it look like it's moving backwards. The objective of the game is to have the car (player) get as many hearts as they can before the health decreases to zero. If the car comes in touch with the hearts the score will increase by 2 and if the car comes in touch with the banana's the health will drecrease by 2. </p>
